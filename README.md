# Data-Driven Portfolio Optimization
*The Homework and Midterm Exam of HKUST ELEC3180 - Data-Driven Portfolio Optimization*

The solutions provided cannot be guaranteed to be 100% correct. They have been revised from the submissions and base on the TAs' solutions as reference. I have chosen not to post the solutions as doing so would defeat the purpose of the exercise.

## Outline
[Homework 1](./Homework1.ipynb)

1. Portfolio Optimization and Risk-Return Tradeoff Analysis using Modern Portfolio Theory

[Homework 2](./Homework2.ipynb)

1. Factor Model Analysis and Optimization for Stock Returns
2. Portfolio Optimization and Sharpe Ratio Analysis Using Shrinkage Estimators

[Homework 3](./Homework3.ipynb)

1. Comparative Analysis of Gradient Descent, Newtonâ€™s Method, Conjugate Gradient Algorithms for Quadratic Minimization
2. Comparative Analysis of Jacobi and Majorization Minimization Algorithms for Convex Optimization

[Midterm Exam](./MidtermExam.ipynb)

1. Risk Parity Portfolio: Asset Allocation and Convex Optimization Analysis
2. Hierarchical Risk Parity: Portfolio Optimization through Clustering, Quasi-Diagonalization, and Recursive Bisection
3. Multi-Factor Models in Walk-Forward Process: Comparative Analysis of Risk Parity, Hierarchical Risk Parity, and Global Minimum Variance Portfolios

The chronological sequence of occurrence was Homework 1, Homework 2, Midterm Exam, Homework 3, which corresponds to the ascending order of complexity and difficulty.
